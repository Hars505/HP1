      This is an example of text that is divided into multiple columns using
      CSS. The text will flow from one column to the next, creating a
      newspaper-like layout. You can adjust the number of columns, the gap
      between them, and the style of the dividing line using CSS properties.
      This technique is useful for improving readability and making better use
      of horizontal space on a webpage.
